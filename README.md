# Health & Wellness Through a Socioeconomic Lens (CIS 545 Final Project)

Data analytics projects have become increasingly popular in recent years, and one project that has the potential to make a significant impact is elucidating the relationship between demographic and nutrition factors and diabetes in NHANES data. By using sophisticated statistical techniques and data visualization tools, this project aims to uncover the underlying patterns and trends that link these variables and identify key risk factors associated with diabetes. With the rising prevalence of diabetes in the US, understanding these relationships can help healthcare providers develop more effective prevention and treatment strategies, ultimately improving the lives of millions of individuals affected by this disease. This project offers an exciting opportunity to apply cutting-edge data analytics techniques to a complex public health problem and contribute to our understanding of the factors that influence diabetes risk.
